# CS-255-M01-Systems-Analysis-and-Design-2025

## About
This repository is part of my CS portfolio at Southern New Hampshire University. It includes two key artifacts that demonstrate my learning in system analysis and design:

- **Business Requirements Document** (from Project One)
- **System Design Document** (from Project Two, including UML diagrams)

Together, these files reflect my ability to gather user requirements and translate them into a working system design using a blend of object- and process-based approaches.

## Repository Contents  

## Project 1 – Business Requirements Document (DriverPass)
**Summary:**  
This document captures client requirements for DriverPass, a driving education business. It outlines what the system should do (functionally and technically) to help customers schedule driving lessons, take online practice tests, and manage appointments.

## Project 2 – System Design Document (DriverPass)

**Summary:**  
This design document translates the business requirements into UML diagrams and technical specifications. It includes a Use Case Diagram, Activity Diagrams, a Sequence Diagram, and a Class Diagram.

## Diagrams and Artifacts

- ✅ Use Case Diagram (DriverPass)
- ✅ Activity Diagram: Schedule Lesson
- ✅ Activity Diagram: Take Practice Test
- ✅ Sequence Diagram: Schedule Lesson
- ✅ Class Diagram (DriverPass System)

## Reflection

**What I Did Well:**  
I believe I communicated the client’s needs effectively by balancing both user stories and system behaviors. My use case and activity diagrams clearly broke down how each type of user interacts with the system. I also organized my system design documentation in a way that would be clear to both developers and nontechnical clients.

**What I’d Revise:**  
If I could revise one part, it would be the first version of my sequence diagram. Initially, I oversimplified the message flow and didn’t account for validation or error-handling. I improved this later but would spend more time thinking through exception scenarios up front next time.

**Interpreting User Needs:**  
To reflect the client's goals, I mapped each request (like lesson scheduling or practice test access) to a specific system behavior and ensured every actor had the right permissions. This process taught me how vital it is to keep end users in mind when designing. Without aligning with user goals, a technically perfect system could still fail in the real world.

**Approach to Software Design:**  
My approach starts with deep listening; understanding what the client says (and what they don’t). I rely heavily on visual modeling (like UML) and always create pseudocode before diving into diagrams. Going forward, I’ll continue using this layered method: requirements first, models second, refinements last.

**Making the Work Maintainable:**  
By keeping documentation clear and organized; with consistent naming, intuitive diagram flows, and minimal jargon. I’ve made it easier for developers or future analysts (including myself) to revisit the design and build on it without confusion.


## Additional Skills Demonstrated

- Requirements gathering and stakeholder communication  
- Object-oriented and process-based system modeling  
- UML tools (Lucidchart) for visual modeling  
- Writing nontechnical documentation for client-facing presentations
